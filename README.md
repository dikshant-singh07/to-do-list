# To-Do List App

## Approach
I built this React To-Do List app using functional components and hooks. The architecture separates concerns through three main components:
- **App Component**: Manages global state and task operations
- **ToDoItem Component**: Handles individual task display and actions
- **AddTaskForm Component**: Manages user input for new tasks

Used React's useState for state management and useEffect for localStorage persistence, ensuring data survives page refreshes.

# Challenges

- **Re-render Optimization**: Solved with proper immutable state updates
- **localStorage Synchronization**: Implemented careful useEffect dependency management
- **Responsive Design**: Created adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- **Form Validation**: Added empty string checking while maintaining good UX

The app successfully implements all required features (add, delete, complete tasks) with a clean, responsive interface.
